Data management mandates from social enterprise minded funders demand open data and publically acessible, useful results.\r\n\r\nResearch data repositories are under pressure to provide web scale enterprise infrastucture, capacity, quality and access to an ever changing audience. A single repository manager may not only be responsible to collect and organize data through its full life cycle to publication and reporting back to funding agencies, but also be required to provide web services to other reseach teams and public outcomes ranging from web sites to mobile applications.\r\n\r\nCurating research data and enabling discovery are hard problems to solve for an international audience and the challenges are growing in complexity everyday.\r\n\r\nOn site repositories will continue to serve a critical growing role as a local cache but must be supported effectively in an ever growing distributed computing context. Leading research institutions and companies with social impact objectives will drive research data to the cloud.\r\n\r\n26 August 2016\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nData Management Maturity Model\r\n\r\n![dmmm](http://cmmiinstitute.com/sites/all/themes/cmmi/images/dmm_diagram.png)\r\nÂ© 2016 CMMI Institute.

In particular, exploring and studying how and why researchers perceive incentives, risks, and rewards for sharing research data may provide additional approaches and paths towards increasing openness.\r\n\r\nThis webinar will be broadcast from SciDataCon during International Data Week in Denver, Colorado, and will feature panelists who plan to discuss their work in the areas of: data as social capital, giving researchers credit for data, and the results of a case study on perceived versus actual risks of data sharing.\r\n\r\nOpen Government Data Competition in South Australia\r\nhttps://twitter.com/SAUnleashed\r\nGovHack Queensland\r\nhttps://twitter.com/GovHackQld\r\nHashtag\r\n'#GovHack2016'\r\n\r\n27 August 2016\r\n\r\n---\r\n",
